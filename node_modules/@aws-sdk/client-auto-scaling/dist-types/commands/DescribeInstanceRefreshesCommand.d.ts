/**
 * <p>Gets information about the instance refreshes for the specified Auto Scaling group.</p>
 *         <p>This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html">instance refresh
 *                 feature</a> in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group
 *             after you make configuration changes.</p>
 *         <p>To help you determine the status of an instance refresh, this operation returns
 *             information about the instance refreshes you previously initiated, including their
 *             status, end time, the percentage of the instance refresh that is complete, and the
 *             number of instances remaining to update before the instance refresh is complete.</p>
 *         <p>The following are the possible statuses: </p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Pending</code> - The request was created, but the operation has not
 *                     started.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>InProgress</code> - The operation is in progress.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Successful</code> - The operation completed successfully.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Failed</code> - The operation failed to complete. You can troubleshoot
 *                     using the status reason and the scaling activities. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Cancelling</code> - An ongoing operation is being cancelled.
 *                     Cancellation does not roll back any replacements that have already been
 *                     completed, but it prevents new replacements from being started. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>
 *                   <code>Cancelled</code> - The operation is cancelled. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * // const { AutoScalingClient, DescribeInstanceRefreshesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-auto-scaling"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new AutoScalingClient(config);
 * const command = new DescribeInstanceRefreshesCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DescribeInstanceRefreshesCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DescribeInstanceRefreshesCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link AutoScalingClientResolvedConfig | config} for AutoScalingClient's `config` shape.
